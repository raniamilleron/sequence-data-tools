# Sequence Data Tools

## Description
This repository contains scripts for analyzing sequence data, including calculating GC content, counting amino acid residues, and generating reverse complements. I am using these tools to deepen my understanding of sequence analysis and Bash scripting.

## Learning Goals
- Practice analyzing genomic sequence data.
- Improve Bash scripting skills for sequence manipulation.

## Files
- `GC_content.sh`: A script to calculate GC content from a given sequence file.
- `reverse_complement.sh`: A script to generate the reverse complement of a DNA sequence.

## Usage
To calculate GC content:
```bash
bash GC_content.sh input.fasta
